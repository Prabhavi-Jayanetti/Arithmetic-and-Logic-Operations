# Arithmetic-and-Logic-Operations
Implemented bit-wise operations on binary images.

 Bit-wise operations are used in image manipulation and for extracting essential parts in the image. Perform bit-wise operations on binary images. 
 
 Bit-wise operations include: NOT, AND, OR, and XOR.
 
 Performed Arithmetic operations using image blending. This is similar to image adding but different weights are given to stretch a feeling of blending or transparency. Added weights to the input images, 0.7 and 0.3 respectively.
 
 Perform Logic operations to separate the logo from the airplane 7a.
